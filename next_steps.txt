[x] hand-code a deck of one card with an image on the front and multiple images on the back
  Need to have a CSV, example back of card:
    <img src='2.png'><img src='3.png'> 
      (can be any #, unspecified, of images)
      UTF-8 export
      no quotes surrounding the html, only the comma delimitation
      when anki importing, check box for "allow HTML"
      images being referenced have to be in the anki media folder already
[x] see if the word "copyright", which is on most ? cards, is detectable by a PDF converter. 
  detect which pages are Q/ which A

[x] SO for nothing returning
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17072683/rmagick-not-opening-multi-page-pdfs-correctly -> possibly relevant

[x] test on Kei computer/phone, see if works
[] need to improve resolution

[] plan and implement the rest

check out PDF -> Anki for Kei, https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oycawjrguqz5yps/AAC2CO-iktt6BB_LJ0zbfrd4a/Dental%20Decks%202013%3A14?dl=0; see pinboard tags on relevant stuff. seems best to find way of pdf->image for ruby, then munge into anki deck format using python and linux code as a guide
